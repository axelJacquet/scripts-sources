# Nodejs deployment

## Installation Process

In the opened confirmation window at Jelastic dashboard, set an Environment name and, optionally, customize its Display Name. Then, select the preferable region (if several are available).

By default, Jelastic will issue a platform built-in SSL certificate for your application, but you have an option to get a Letâ€™s Encrypt for your custom domain if required. Then press Install.
